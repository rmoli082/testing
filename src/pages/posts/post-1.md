# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-04-14

## Daily Mood Journal
 
 ### Describe the situation or event that lead to your unhelpful thoughts/emotions/behaviours
 I was standing in front of my whiteboard in the morning planning my day/week out.

 |    Emotion    | %Now  | %Goal |  %After |
 |:--------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|
 | Anxious       |   90  |  30   |         |
 | Panicky       |  100  |  10   |         |
 | Pessimistic   |   85  |  25   |         |
 | Ashamed       |   80  |  10   |         |

 ### How are these emotions or thoughts an expression of my positive qualities?

 |  Thought/Feeling  |          Advantages         |         Core Values         |
 |:------------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------|
 | Anxious, Panicky  | These feelings can help show things that are important to me | It shows that I care about getting things done and actually putting the work in |
 | Pessimistic | It can prevent me from getting my hopes up too high so I don't feel disappointed if I don't succeed | This shows that I'm realistic because I've already had failures with this, and indicates a strong desire to change |
 | Ashamed | This feeling is appropriate because it indicates I know that I'm not pulling my weight | It shows that I still want to change things and that I know I have to put the work in |

 ### Cognitive Distortions

 | Unhelpful (Automatic) | Before | After | Distortions | Helpful (Reframe) |
 |:----------------------|:------:|:-----:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
 | I'm hopeless | 100 |  | LAB, ER |  |
 | I can't do this | 100 |  | FT, MAG, ER | I **can** do this. I'm blowing things out of proportion. It's not a big deal if I do fail. I can just pick myself back up, learn from my mistakes, and keep on going. If I'm doing *that*, I'm doing *this*.|
 | I'm going to fuck up again like always. | 100 | 30 | AON, OG, MF, DtP, MR, MAG, ER, SHD, LAB | I'm not a fuckup and I don't always fuck things up. Progress isn't linear. Even if I don't get *most* of what I wanted done, I get *some* things done, so I'm always better off than I was before. Fuckups aren't really fuckups, they're opportunities to learn. |
