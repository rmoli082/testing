### Describe the situation or event that lead to your unhelpful thoughts/emotions/behaviours
 I was standing in front of my whiteboard in the morning planning my day/week out.

 |    Emotion    | %Now  | %Goal |  %After |
 |:--------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|
 | Ashamed       |   75  |  30   |         |
 | Worried, Nervous | 99 | 10 |   |
 | Lonely        | 100 | 40 |   |


### How are these emotions or thoughts an expression of my positive qualities?

 |  Thought/Feeling  |          Advantages         |         Core Values         |
 |:------------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------|
 | Anxious, Panicky  | These feelings can help sho | It shows that I care about  |


### Cognitive Distortions

 | Unhelpful (Automatic) | Before | After | Distortions | Helpful (Reframe) |
 |:----------------------|:------:|:-----:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
 | I don't know why I keep trying if I never finish everything on my list and I always stop using them. | 100    |       | AoN, OG, MF, DtP, FT, ER, SHLD, LAB, BLAME | This isn't about finishing everything on my list every day. That's impossible. The list is there so that I can get through at least all the most important things, and it makes me aware if I"m missing anything. On most days I get most of what I have on my list done and that's what matters. As I get better at doing those things, I'll start being able to do some of the other things more regularly too. |
 | I have conversations and arguments in my head with people and the largest part of the things I think about in these moments are negative. And I truly believe these people would say these things. And I often try and twist thing so they're in the wrong and I'm in the right. | 100 |   | MR, OB | This is just something I need to stop. I should revisit my Gremlin taming because that's a Gremlin I need to take back down. I know this isn't really what this section is for, but it's an insight that sort of fits along the lines of bashing cognitive distortions.
